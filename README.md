# Tic Tac Toe Game in Python

This repository contains two implementations of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python, designed to showcase different approaches to creating a simple, command-line based game.

## Files in this Repository

- `tictactoe1.py`: The first version of the Tic Tac Toe game. This implementation provides a basic version of the game for two players on the same computer. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and players take turns to mark their symbol ('X' or 'O') on the grid. The game checks for a win or a draw after every move.

- `tictactoe2.py`: The second version of the Tic Tac Toe game, which is an enhanced and more dynamic version of the first. It supports a customizable grid size, allowing for a more varied and challenging gameplay. This version also includes improved validation for player input and a more sophisticated check for wins and draws.

## How to Play

To play the game, you will need Python installed on your computer. You can run either version of the game by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python tictactoe1.py
```

or

```bash
python tictactoe2.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to make your moves. The game will automatically determine if there is a winner or if the game ends in a draw.
